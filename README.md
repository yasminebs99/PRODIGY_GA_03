# PRODIGY_GA_03  

## Text Generation with Markov Chains  

### Description  
A Python-based project leveraging Markov Chains for generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on input data. This project is ideal for creative writing, chatbot responses, or simulating natural language, enabling the generation of meaningful text from probabilistic models.  

### Features  

- **Dynamic Text Generation**  
  Generates realistic and grammatically coherent text using Markov Chain models trained on input datasets.  
- **Customizable N-Gram Models**  
  Offers flexibility in choosing the size of n-grams (e.g., unigrams, bigrams, trigrams) for varying levels of context sensitivity.  
- **Seamless Integration**  
  Compatible with larger NLP pipelines or standalone projects like automated storytelling or data augmentation.  
- **Interactive Tuning**  
  Includes tools to visualize and tweak transition probabilities for enhanced control over generated text.  

### Technologies Used  

- Python  
- NLTK (for tokenization and preprocessing)  
- NumPy (for efficient probability calculations)  
- Pandas (optional, for structured data handling)
